# renet-transport-naia-webrtc
Just enough hacks to hook up [renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet) with [Naia socket](https://github.com/naia-lib/naia) to provide WebRTC communication.

**Disclaimer:**
This was just to try out the new Renet transport rewrite and get *something* working, it should probably not be used for anything serious.
